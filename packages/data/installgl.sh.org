# jehsom's and dn's glftpd installer script
  VERSION="2.0.6"

# REPORT ANY BUGS TO: #glftpd@efnet

# CHANGELOG
#
# v2.0.6
# new:     Now works with rlinetd
# v2.0.3
# fixed:   freebsd version detection and devfs mount fix from tittof
# new:     support for launchd on macos from tittof
# v2.0.2 (???)
# fixed:   Empty-dir creation had a bug (bugid #11), thanks to mz for reporting
# change:  As psxc isn't active anymore, the report-to is now generalized
# fixed:   Resolving tests were still against glftpd.com
# fixed:   Due to changing to git, some empty dirs are not present in the dirtree
#          anymore, and thus not copied to the installation location.
#          The script now creates these.
# new:     Creation of dev/full on linux and freebsd
# fixed:   Made creation of x509 certificate work on NetBSD - NetBSD by default
#          is missing the openssl.cnf file.
# change:  If an only_from line is found in xinetd.conf, it will be commented
#          out automatically. (Too few actually read the output from the
#          installer)
# change:  Checked for xinetd or inetd before we started asking questions - this
#          way people don't have to do almost a full install before it fails.
#
# v2.0.1 (x-mas 2005)
# fixed:   mknod is no longer supported on fbsd6 - added workaround.
# fixed:   European week was added to crontab but not (x)inetd.
# fixed:   Added chmod 777 site/ since this is a repeating Q in channel.
# new:     Added a test to make sure there is no only_from line in xinetd.conf.
# fixed:   Check that the 'bash' we found (and use) is actually a binary, and
#          also make sure it's not a faked sh renamed to bash
# change:  Changed the suggestion when choosing tcpd or not.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# v2.0.1RC5 (Nov. 2005)
# change:  Changed default port from 21 to 1337 - no port should be <1024.
# fixed:   Did a few minor fixes with the resolv sequence.
# change:  The cert is now read from the conf and not the (x)inetd.
# v2.0.1RC2 (May 2005)
# fixed:   The sequence grabbing the necessary libs did not work on newer linux
#          versions.
# v2.0.1RC1
# fixed:   Small bug on osx install
# v2.0.0
# fixed:   Fixed missing jailpart in timezone area.
# new:     Made sure the linux run-time linker is copied.
# fix:     In case 'which' doesn't exists or is not in the PATH variable, an
#          alternate method has been added.
# change:  RC8 does no longer support non-tls - changed the installer to
#          reflect that change.
# v2.0.RC6
# new:     Added cpying of some necessary libs for osx/darwin.
# fixed:   If the bin 'dig' didn't exists, it would not check the content of
#          resolv.conf - added support for nslookup as well.
# v2.0.RC5:
# new:     Added support for fixing (potential) localtime problems.
# v2.0.RC3:
# fix:     Script checked ip's within commented lines in resolv.conf.
# change:  The routine to create device nodes have changed.
# v2.0.RC2:
# new:     Now copies resolv.conf into glftpd's etc/ dir (so bnc's etc work).
# change:  SSL-cert is now valid for 1024 days (was 365).
# change:  Renamed glftpd.conf in the dest. dir to glftpd.conf.dist.
# new:     Added output on compiliation of sources.
# fix:     Fixed warning on the osx/darwin platform.
# fix:     Cleanup and optimizing.
# fix:     The killghost bin was compiled with the wrong IPC-key.
# fix:     The routine to copy dynamic libs on OpenBSD v3.3 (and below) did
#          not work. Not sure if this is important, as the interpreter changed
#          from a.out to elf as well in 3.4 (ie, glftpd won't work anyway).
# fix:     Did not report if a file failed to compile.
# new:     Added support for european weeks for the reset binary.
# new:     Makes sure groupdir/files are chmod'ed ok.
# change:  Dynamic libs are now copied to a mirrored dir-layout instead of
#          glroot's default /lib dir.
# change:  Changed the version number to match the version of glftpd.
# fix:     TCPD under fbsd/nbsd was used either way. fixed. (iwdisb)
# fix:     Some sources under bin/sources was modified a bit. That lead to
#          a minor change in the installer.
# fix:     GCC was hardcoded as the compiler used. Now uses either CC or GCC.
# change:  Now compiles bins with "-Wall -O2 -o" if GCC is the compiler
#          used. (If it fails it will try again with just "-o".)
# change:  When creating a ssl cert, the servicename is used as servbase if
#          nothing else is specified.
# new:     Added "sections" to the installer.
# v1.2.4:
# fix:     Redid the ldd sequence which reads dynamic libs - should fix
#          warnings on fedora core 2 and others.
# fix:     If you installed multiple instances of glftpd, the crontab entry
#          was overwritten.
# new:     L33T banner!
# fix:     iwdisb fixed lots of bugs (mainly for *bsd) in the jail part.
# new:     initial (experimental) support for OS-X (darwin).
# new:     initial (experimental) support for NetBSD.
# fix:     creation of /dev/null & /dev/zero on *bsd didn't work.
# change:  now shows progressbar when creating a cert, and gives some debug
#          info in installgl.debug if the cert creation fails.
# v1.2.3:
# fix:     Fixed a bug affecting FreeBSD 5.0 and 5.1 owners (elf interpreter
#          did not change dir until 5.2).
# new:     Added "real" support for multiple instances of glftpd.
# fix:     Fixed a minor bug when openssl is not found.
# v1.2.2:
# new:     Support for OpenBSD.
# new:     Support for FreeBSD 5.x. (and 4.x)
# new:     Support for multiple instances of glftpd.
# fix:     Fixed a bug in the creation of jailgroup under FreeBSD.
# change:  If bash does not exist on system, the script will now cry for help.
# v1.2.1:
# change:  Changed the text for TLS certificate creation since its no longer
#          required for the installation.
# new:     Copy egrep to the rest of the binaries as well.
# new:     Added www.glftpd.at to recomended sites =)
# v1.2:
# new:     Included installation support for TLS / Turranius.
#
# v1.14:
# fix:     There was a bug in adding the proper -s string for glstrings if
#          you didn't use the default install dir of /glftpd.  This has now
#          been fixed.
# v1.13:
# fix:     there was the possibity of your xinetd.conf file getting erased.
#          Code was changed to first verify if the /etc/xinetd.d directory exists,
#          if not, it will be created and the includedir line added to your
#          xinetd.conf
# v1.12
# change:  updated a few warning messages.
# new:     you will now be told if the private group you are trying to use
#          already exists and options to change it.
# change:  if your system contains both inetd and xinetd config files, you
#          will be asked what you want to use.  If only one can be found, then
#          that will be used automatically.
# v1.11
# fix:     changed the code when restarting xinetd, it was incompatible with
#          some systems.
# change:  will now look at /etc/xinetd.conf and verify you have set the
#          includedir for xinetd.d, if so a separate glftpd file will
#          be created, else the information will be added to /etc/xinetd.conf
# v1.10
# change:  added some more binaries to the required binaries list, mainly
#          to make Bloody_A happy.
# fix:     script will now look for a compiler to user before compiling
#          the sources, you will get an error message if one can not be
#          found.
# v1.09
# fix:     some more bugs in the code.
# v1.08
# fix:     some of my own grammar mistakes.
# change:  update a lot of the code to improve things, thanks to our good
#          friend, Jehsom.
# v1.07 -  dn
# new:     will now ask if you want to run glftpd in a jailed environment and
#          set it all up accordingly.
# change:  the output when copying the needed binaries or compiling the source
#          files.  Now it just tells you which have failed, or if all were
#          successful
# fix:     Now the glroot path and the jaildir path must start with a /
# change:  Instead of exiting if the glroot path or jaildir path is a /,
#          you will now get to enter a new dir name
# fix:     Crontab entries will be removed on a reinstall so you don't get
#          duplicates
# new/fix: will now configure glftpd properly for use with or without tcpd
# fix:     there was a bug in the [T]ry Again option when creating the install
#          dir for glftpd
# change:  updated the final message to include jehsom's new website
#          information and added mine. :)
# fix:     some spelling mistakes (has Archimede been in here?)
# change:  removed -r /etc/glftpd.conf and -n 1 from the inetd and xinetd lines as
#          they are they default.
# change:  remove -r /etc/glftpd.conf from the reset line in crontab as that is the
#          default
# v1.06 -  maestro^
# new:     permissions set on ftp-data/users
# change:  glftpd.conf now moved to glftpd.conf.dist after install
# fix:     not properly reinstalling on top of itself from the glroot dir
# fix:     some error messages werent printing properly
