## How to do an Unattended installation

After a regular installation you are left with a file called install.cache located in install dir that will be used automatically the next time you run the installation script. Here are the various variables in install.cache if you want to make your installation unattended.

```
sitename="Test" # Name of the site. Don't use space in sitename. 
port="2010" # Port for the FTP
device="/dev/sda1" # What device to use for /site
channelnr="2" # How many channels the bot will be in
channame1="#main n nopass" # Channelname of 1st chan with no password requirement
channame2="#flood y testing" # Channelname of 2nd chan with password requirement
announcechannels="#main #flood" # Announce channels

## FAQ

Q. Is there anything I need to know before I install glFTPD using this installer?

A. You have to run this script as root and glFTPD gets installed to /glftpd and the eggdrop to /glftpd/sitebot. Please
   ensure that the things that are listed under Requirements in this file are installed before running this script.
   Also, this script has only been tested in Debian and Slackware systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Is the installer going to be hard to use or ask me anything i'm not going to know the answers to?

A. Not really, just run the install.sh and answer the questions that come up as you progress,
   there are brief explainations of most of the questions/options you will face :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. OK so I have installed glFTPD now what?

A. After the installation you have to create the initial userfile for sitebot or it will not start up.
   Do that by doing:
   ```
   su - sitebot -c "/glftpd/sitebot/sitebot -m"
   ```
   Now your bot should be running on the irc network that you specified during the installation. Type the following and 
   replace sitename with the sitename you chose during installation for the site:
   ```
   /msg sitename hello
   ```
   By now you should get a reply from the bot with further instructions. Once everything is set up then in the future the 
   bot will be automatically started by crontab if not running by checking every 10 min. To manually start the eggdrop after 
   you set up the sitebot you do:
   ```
   su - sitebot -c "/glftpd/sitebot/sitebot"
   ```
